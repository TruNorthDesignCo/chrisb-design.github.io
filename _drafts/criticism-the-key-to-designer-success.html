  Criticism can be tough to deal with. Nobody really wants to be told that what 
  they've done isn't good enough or that their time might have been wasted. However, 
  any experienced designer will tell you the truth straight up: a designer that can't 
  take criticism won't survive their first month of work. The ability to accept 
  criticism, evaluate its intent, and iterate on that feedback is key to making the 
  best product possible. So for those fresh-faced freelancers looking to get started in 
  the industry, here are a few tips for improving your ability to both give and receive 
  feedback.
</p>

<h5>No, we're not sadists</h5>
<p>
  It's no secret that designers have a reputation for being blunt with their feedback. 	
  We're known for being thick-skinned people, but it's not because we enjoy hearing 
  people tear us down. It's because we want to create improvement as fast as possible and recognize 
  that nobody gets it right on the first draft. Yes, you can sing me 
  praises about my work until the proverbial cows come home, but what 
  good will that do me? To be frank, 99% of the time we're working on a deadline and time 
  is money. We don't really want to talk about the proverbial flowers in the field; we 
  just need the proverbial cattle back in the proverbial pasture because we need to put 
  some proverbial steaks on the proverbial grill by yesterday. Yay proverbs.
</p>
  
<p>
  The reason we can just take it on the chin and work with the feedback we receive 
  is simple: <strong>we recognize that it's not personal</strong>. When we give feedback, 
  we aren't telling you that you're bad and that you should feel bad. We just know that things are 
  bound to be a little rough around the edges, and a sharp file will clean things up much quicker. 
  For that reason, I don't expect you to coddle me when the first draft wasn't great. I just want to 
  identify the good and the bad so I know where to improve the product.
</p>

<h5>Censorship makes awful feedback</h5>
<p>
  I hate hearing the phrase 'It's perfect!' during proofing meetings. Almost every client 
  I've ever worked with has used it, and every time a red flag started waving in my 
  subconscious because I know with certainty that the next word they utter will be a 
  'but'. Not only does that send a mixed signal to me as a designer, but it's also an 
  annoying misuse of the term 'perfect'. I get that people want designers to feel good 
  about the work they do, but it's just not useful feedback.
</p>
  
<p>
  I don't want my clients to leave the table with a product they aren't happy with, but it has 	
  happened because they didn't like they style but weren't willing to say it to my face. I've also had 
  horridly embarrasing typos go to press that co-workers admitted to seeing in proof but didn't 
  mention because they weren't sure if the error in question was actually a typo. Both of these
  are definitely not good things for any party involved. So, second tip: <strong>Don't be shy</strong>.
</p>

<p>
  If something catches your eye that makes you question it, just ask the question. Don't worry about how 
  stupid it sounds in your head. On that same token, If you don't like it or think there might be an 
  error/ weird issue/ social faux-pas/ unintended innuendo, just say it. Whether it's a matter of taste 
  or ignorance or just poor design choices, we need to know. If you as a designer are unsure about 
  something in your work, bring it up and have them weigh in. If you noticed and nobody else did, it may 
  not be a problem after all. If somebody else noticed, then it's definitely a problem.
</p>

<h5>Build 'em up, break 'em down</h5>
<p>
  Remember, the point of all of this is to create constructive criticism. Yes, we're 
  going to look at individual pieces of the product, but what we're really after is the 
  intent behind the criticism. If I don't like something you put in front of me, you're 
  going to hear it. However, the next words out of my mouth will always be why&mdash;and 
  that's the key. 
</p>

<p>
  When you are part of any proofing or feedback cycle, make sure you <strong>give 
  reasons why you like/ dislike something</strong>. On the flipside of that token, <strong>look to 
  understand the reasoning behind feedback you are given<strong>. Some people are really good about 
  sharing their reasoning, but others will need a little coaxing. It is often the case that a small 
  adjustment will fix an overall design even though your critics will only tell you that they dislike 
  the whole thing.
</p>
  
<p>
  As a final note, I also find it useful to point out the things that I don't want the designer to 
  change. Knowing the high points in a design is just as important as knowing the low points, and 
  sharing that information both provides a fulcrum to build around and gives them a little dose of 
  serotonin. Trust me, all of us deserve a little more serotonin.
