  Criticism can be tough to deal with. Nobody really wants to be told that what 
  they've done isn't good enough or that their time might have been wasted. However, 
  any experienced designer will tell you the truth straight up: a designer that can't 
  take criticism won't survive their first month of work. The ability to accept 
  criticism, evaluate its intent, and iterate on that feedback is key to making the 
  best product possible. So for those fresh-faced freelancers looking to get started in 
  the industry, here are a few tips for improving your ability to both give and receive 
  feedback.
</p>

<h5>No, we're not sadists</h5>
<p>
  It's no secret that designers have a reputation for being blunt with their feedback. 	
  We're known for being thick-skinned people, but it's not because we enjoy hearing 
  people tear us down. It's because we recognize the value in good feedback and want to 
  create improvement as fast as possible. We also recognize that nobody gets it right 
  every time, and the first draft is very rarely the best one. Yes, you can sing me 
  praises about my work until the proverbial cows come home, but what 
  good will that do me? To be frank, 99% of the time we're working on a deadline and time 
  is money. We don't really want to talk about the proverbial flowers in the field; we 
  just need the proverbial cattle back in the proverbial pasture because I need to put 
  some proverbial steaks on the proverbial grill by yesterday. Yay proverbs.
  
  The reason we can just take it on the chin and work with the feedback we receive 
  is simple: <strong>we recognize that it's not personal</strong>. When we give feedback, 
  we aren't telling you that you're bad and that you should feel bad. Odds are, if we 
  didn't recognize your talent or your value we wouldn't be offering our help in the 
  first place. We just know that things are bound to be a little rough around the edges, 
  and a sharp file will clean things up much quicker. For that reason, I don't expect you 
  to coddle me when the first draft wasn't great. I just want a handful of people to 
  identify the good and the bad so I know where to improve the product.
</p>

<h5>Censorship makes awful feedback</h5>
<p>
  I hate hearing the phrase 'It's perfect!' during proofing meetings. Almost every client 
  I've ever worked with has used it, and every time a red flag started waving in my 
  subconscious because I know with certainty that the next word they utter will be a 
  'but'. Not only does that send a mixed signal to me as a designer, but it's also an 
  annoying misuse of the term 'perfect'. I get that people want designers to feel good 
  about the work they do, but it's just not useful feedback. I don't want my clients to leave the table with a product they aren't happy with, but it has happened. 
  
  
  2. Don't lie about your feedback. If you don't like it, say it. 
  3. Don't be shy. Just say it, no matter how stupid it sounds or seems.
</p>




<h5>Build 'em up, break 'em down</h5>
<p>
  Remember, the point of all of this is to create constructive criticism. Yes, we're 
  going to look at individual pieces of the product, but what we're really after is the 
  intent behind the criticism. If I don't like something you put in front of me, you're 
  going to hear it. However, the next words out of my mouth will always be why&mdash;and 
  that's the key.
  

  4. Give reasons why and recognize their reasoning
  5. Reinforce the parts that you <em>don't</em> want to change.
