  We’ve all heard the popular meme at some point in the past few years: ‘If it’s
  on the internet, it must be true.‘ It’s funny to laugh at, funny to attribute
  it to [insert historical pre-internet figure here], funny as a conversation
  quip. However, I find it funny how often people fall for the stigma.
</p>

<p>
  Overly cheesy introductions aside, the internet is a wide world of anonymous
  opportunity--an excellent source of both shady and legitimate content. Whether
  you’re new to the wonderful world of graphic design or just like building
  hobby projects, there are a few important guidelines you should make sure you
  abide by:
</p>

<h5>Never trust the word free.</h5>
<p>
  Don’t get me wrong; there are legitimate sources of excellent free content on
  the internet. However, the anonymous denizens of the interwebs take the
  legitimate content and all too willingly distribute it illegitimately. Even
  worse, they’ll sell someone else’s licensed product at a lower rate and pocket
  the funds themselves.
</p>

<p>
  Be sure that you are receiving your product from a
  legitimate source. If an author or creator isn’t credited, it likely isn’t
  legitimate. If an author is credited, don’t hesitate to ask them where to
  purchase the product. Keep in mind that most font foundries or stock sites
  don’t have malicious intent. Most of these sites aggregate content provided by
  the public at large, who can be very difficult to monitor and police.
</p>

<h5>Whether you paid or not, read the product license.</h5>
<p>
  It can be very hard to tell the difference between a pirated file and a
  legitimately sourced one. The best and most reliable way to ensure that the
  fonts or stock imagery are legitimate is to read the Terms of Use on the
  product website or the product license included with the file.
</p>

<p>
  While reading, be sure to denote any limitations--i.e., some stock photos
  require that a designer credit is included within view of the image. Some
  fonts will allow commercial use, but prohibit sharing the files with a third
  party designer or differentiate between online and print usage. The best
  policy I’ve found is simple: If the content doesn’t have a license with it, I
  don’t use it. <strong>No exceptions</strong>. I also try to avoid keeping any
  fonts that have a ‘Personal Use Only’ limitation included because it’s far
  too easy to just pick the best font in InDesign or Photoshop and forget to
  check the license.
</p>

<h5>Never assume you won’t get caught.</h5>
<p>
  Just don’t. A font or a picture may seem like a petty thing, but people spend
  time and sweat to create a quality product, and they deserve recognition or
  compensation if they choose to ask for it. If your client brings the files to
  you, question them on the source. Just because they ask you to build
  something with the product doesn’t mean you aren’t liable. If you aren’t
  certain that they produced the content themselves, ask them about their
  sources and see if they have proper license to use the content.
</p>

<h5>So what <u>CAN</u> I use?</h5>
<p>
  There are certainly options out there. I personally tend toward sites like
  <a href="https://www.creativefabrica.com/">Creative Fabrica</a> and
  <a href="https://www.behance.net">Behance</a>, where fonts come directly from
  the creators&mdash;which means they get to pocket the funds. Materials on these sites
  frequently go for cheap on sales and in bundles as well, meaning they aren't
  going to break the bank. Freebies float through both of these mediums
  frequently, as well.
</p>

<p>
  Keep in mind, most of these freebies are partial fonts
  (like uppercase only), Single styles in a family, or plain fonts. Don't expect
  to get all 11 styles in a family or all the swashes/ ligatures/ alternates that
  the designer created for it. In my opinion, you should pay for those anyway.
</p>

<p>
  If you <em>really</em> can't afford to
  just buy the font (greed is not a justification here), your best bet is to
  look for materials produced under the <strong><a href="https://creativecommons.org/choose/zero/">
  Creative Commons (CC0)</a></strong> license. As long as you see that
  disclaimer, whatever font or photo you're looking at are free game. Sites like
  <a href="https://www.pexels.com">Pexels</a> and <a href="https://www.toptal.com/designers/subtlepatterns/">
  Subtle Patterns</a> fall under this category, though it's important to note
  that there are caveats. In example, Pexels has "Sponsored Content" at the
  bottom of every search page that is not free, and Subtle Patterns requires you
  to link back to their site and to their license wherever you use their content.
</p>

<p>
  In addition to CC0, you may also see fonts fall under what is referred to as
  the <strong><a href="https://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=OFL">
  Open Font License (OFL)</a></strong>. It's essentially the same license, but
  refers to fonts specifically and strongly encourages sharing your own
  contributions. Sites like <a href="https://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/">
  The League of Moveable Type</a>, <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google
  Fonts</a>, and <a href="https://fontlibrary.org/">The Font Library</a> fall
  under this category. All of these options are generally safe for your use, but
  make sure you <em>check the license anyway. <strong>Seriously.</strong></em>
  It's boring, but this stuff matters.
