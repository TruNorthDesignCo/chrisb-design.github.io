  So, being the attentive and dedicated student of advertising that you are,
  you’ve already read up on why online advertising is king, and you’re ready to
  dive in. However, before you launch head first into the pool that is internet
  marketing, I’d admonish you to learn one more important principle.
</p>

<p>
  If you want to be successful with your online advertising, you need to first
  understand how to read your results. There’s no sense in funnelling your
  money into something that won’t pay off, and most marketing platforms come
  with the expectation that you already understand a compendium of marketing
  terms and buzzwords. There is a breathtaking amount of depth behind the
  metrics available to you, but in this article we’re going to focus on the
  basics. Boiled down to its most basic form, online metrics are focused around
  one essential building block: the impression.
</p>

<h5>What is an impression?</h5>
<p>
  Impressions are used as the basic performance measure of any given online ad.
  Basically, an impression is an instance that your ad was loaded onto a
  website. Pretty simple, right? Let's make it more complicated. Generally,
  impressions are split into two categories in today's climate: <strong>served</strong>
  and <strong>viewed</strong>. In general, served impressions count any time
  your ad was loaded onto a page, whereas viewed impressions only count ads
  that users scrolled into view of.
</p>

<p>
  Initially, served impressions were the only type of impression that were delivered
  to customers, which is fine. However, an attentive marketer can tell you that
  this comes with a distinct caveat: even though your ad was loaded onto the
  page, that doesn’t mean that the reader actually scrolled down to the
  position that your ad was served. The poor thing could has been hovering right
  outside your audience's view without ever getting its moment in the spotlight.
  This is a fairly important distinction to make because not all served
  impressions have a chance to become a <strong>conversion</strong>&mdash; also
  known as a lead or a sale.
</p>

<p>
  Recent advances in online marketing have drawn a distinction between the two,
  and a lot of focus is being put into making sure that viewed impressions
  become the standard instead of served impressions. At the time of writing
  this hasn’t happened yet, so in the meantime it’s important to make sure that
  you’re paying attention to which type of impression you’re buying. For now,
  many popular sites give you both numbers so that you can parse the data for
  yourself. If a distinction isn’t made, chances are they’re reporting a served
  impression. Keep in mind that viewed impressions have an implicit guarantee
  baked into them; until they become the norm buying viewed impressions only
  may come at a premium depending on your advertiser.
</p>

<h5>Great. I know what impressions are. How many should I buy?</h5>
<p>
  Good question. Unfortunately, this is a question you need to answer for
  yourself. These are most often sold according to availability (though
  sometimes can be purchased to deliver until you hit the goal number). Let’s
  liken availability to fishing: it depends on when you’re throwing the net,
  what the population is, how large a net you’re throwing, and whose boat
  you’re fishing from.
</p>

<p>
  Returning to non-metaphorical representations, this is
  all affected by the specificity of your search criteria, by your geographic
  location and its population, and by how many viewers your publisher receives.
  As every fisherman/ advertiser will tell you, everything under the sun&mdash;
  including the time of day and day of the week&mdash;influences how many
  impressions are available to you.
</p>

<p>
  Due to the extreme number of variables involved in calculating that number,
  this is a question better answered by the website you’re publishing from. The
  best guidance I can give is to define the way impressions are sold before you
  shake on the deal. do your research and find out how they track their metrics,
  what their optimal viewing times are, and keep track of any additional fees
  that would be accrued should you vie for more specific delivery. Once that's
  done, you can talk to your advertiser about your purchasing model.
</p>

<h5>Purchasing model?</h5>
<p>
  Yes. Most advertisers have multiple purchase options available to their
  clients. Some don't, and in those cases most of their advertising is probably
  a CPM model (described below). Generally speaking, however, there are three
  common purchasing formats online:
</p>


<h5>1- CPM (Cost per Thousand)</h5>
<p>
  This is far and away the most common format. I know, I know. The 'M' is
  kind of misleading. It’s a throwback to latin numerals, wherein
  one-thousand was represented by the numeral 'M'. Basically, you pledge to
  buy a bundle of impressions by the thousand for X amount of dollars and
  the publisher delivers them on their website. Depending on the
  advertiser’s traffic and rates, you can often adjust your impressions to
  run throughout a certain period or front-loaded (all at once as fast as
  possible), or you can run in certain geographic zones or times of day. U
  sually, the more specific you are, the higher the cost will be.
</p>

<h5>2- PPC (Pay per Click)</h5>
<p>
  Also referred to as Cost-per-click (or CPC), these are delivered much
  like CPM ads are delivered, but instead of paying every time the ad is
  served or displayed, instead you only pay for the ones that readers click
  on. This has the benefit of guaranteeing that you only pay for interested
  customers who took action. The catch, of course, is that you’re paying
  out the nose for that benefit&mdash;and I mean a lot more.
</p>

<h5>3- Sponsorship</h5>
<p>
  Sponsorships in online advertising work much the same as they do in any
  other medium: You buy the space, and that publisher puts your name or artwork
  in a prominent position on their product for a set amount of time.
  Sponsorships tend to have both high visibility and high costs. While they
  often perform better than other ad spaces, they typically don’t come with a
  guaranteed number of impressions&mdash;which makes sense, because if you’re
  sponsoring an ice cream social they can’t guarantee how many people will
  show up or how much interest it will garner. You’ll have to evaluate the
  risk vs. reward of each sponsorship on a case-by-case basis, though most
  publishers will find a way to guarantee you get your money’s worth.
